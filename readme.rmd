# Routing Project

> This code was developed when I started on my Master's Thesis during Summer of 2017.
  The objective was to figure out a way to get the route information knowing the starting and the end coordinates when you are going to drive.

### Output
  
  - The output is the node.html file, it can be found in the repository here.
  - Uses the OSRM API and OSM API to get the data. OSRM server crashes often though. I later figured out that mapbox API is does the same job but more reliable. But Mapbox have limit of 50000 free queries per month.
  - leaflet package is used to plot the info on the map and generate the .html file.
  - It shows the details like Turning angle, Max Speed, no of lanes  and type of highway.
